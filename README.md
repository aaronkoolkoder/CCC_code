# CCC_code
Created by Aaron Merchant

A list and log of all the CCC/Canadian Computing Competition code I have completed.

I began to work on these problems in early Grade 10.
I used python for all of them.

These questions are located at https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/ and https://dmoj.ca/

You can find me at aaronmerchant08@gmail.com or https://dmoj.ca/user/aaronkoolkid where i submit the questions

# Info about the difficulty of questions
Junior Competition
1 and 2	Straightforward
(e.g. basic loops and conditions)
3 and 4	More challenging
(e.g. some combination of loops, conditions and counting)
5	Some advanced material
(e.g. recursion, two-dimensional arrays, efficient/clever algorithms)

Senior Competition
1 and 2	Basic algorithms
(e.g. sorting, searching)
3 and 4	More advanced algorithms
(e.g. careful counting, some mathematical reasoning)
5	IOI level question
